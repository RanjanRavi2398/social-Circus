# Predicting the Impact of a Tweet

We can say that predictive Analytics.

'Impact' as a value that could help , if the tweet could go viral.

# Source of dataset
 
 Dataset is given by Chronicle's data team . Dataset have 15 features and 1 dependent variable(also called as the output variable; Here it is called as 'Imapct')
 
 Post Content - The text in the tweet
Sentiment score - Ranges from -20 to +20 (0 - neutral)
Post Length - The length of the tweet
Hashtag Count - The number of hashtags used in the tweet
Content URL Count - The number of URLs mentioned in the tweet
Tweet Count - The total number of tweets posted by the author of the tweet
Followers Count - The number of followers of the author of the post
Listed Count - the number of lists the post author is a part of
Media Type - The media type of the post (Text, image, video)

# Steps Which i have followed to deal with dataset,

As par the task is given to me, To implement decision tree, linear regression and Artificial Neural network.
I have split the dataset into 80:20(training, validation).

I have followed various steps to deal with this dataset.

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Data Transformation
3. Features Scaling
4. Feature Selection
5. Feature Engineering
6. Model Training and Evaluation
7. Cross -validation

After this steps , I have got rsquare values of decision tree  is 0.50 ,linear regression is 0.27 and by using neural network. I have got rsquare values around 0.85.

so, that neural network is good for this predictive analystics dataset.
